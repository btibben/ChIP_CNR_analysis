# ChIP_CNR_analysis

Repository for code associated with the analysis of ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN data from my postdoctoral research project _Characterizing non-coding somatic variants associated with glucocorticoid resistance in pediatric ALL_

Datasets include:
- CUT&RUN for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in Nalm6 cells
- ChIP-seq for GR in B-ALL cell lines
- CUT&RUN for LEF1 in B-ALL cell lines
